# PillChecker Web App

PillChecker helps users find out if two medications are safe to take at the same time.

## Data Pipeline

To ensure a license-free and up-to-date knowledge base, the application uses an automated pipeline:

1.  **Fetch**: A sync script downloads bulk JSON drug label partitions directly from the **OpenFDA** public domain repository.
2.  **Parse**: The script extracts specific Structured Product Labeling (SPL) fields: `drug_interactions`, `contraindications`, and `warnings`.
3.  **Store**: These structured text blocks are stored in a local **SQLite** database (`data/fda_interactions.db`) indexed by RxCUI and Drug Name.
4.  **Runtime Inference**: During a check, the engine performs a keyword scan across sections. If a match is found in the `contraindications` section, it is categorized as **Major**; matches in `interactions` or `warnings` are categorized as **Moderate/Minor**.
5.  **Automate**: The pipeline is triggered weekly via GitHub Actions and auto-bootstraps during the first deployment via a Docker entrypoint script.

## Drug Identification Pipeline

The API uses a two-pass identification strategy to convert unstructured OCR text into standardized medical data:

1.  **Pass 1 (NER)**: Uses the **[OpenMed-NER-PharmaDetect](https://huggingface.co/OpenMed/OpenMed-NER-PharmaDetect-ModernClinical-149M)** model (a 149M parameter transformer) from Hugging Face to extract chemical entities (e.g., "Ibuprofen") from noisy text.
2.  **Pass 2 (Fallback)**: If NER fails to find a drug, the system performs an approximate term search using the **RxNorm REST API** on major text blocks to identify brand names (e.g., "Advil").
3.  **Enrichment**: A **Regex-based parser** extracts dosages (e.g., "400mg") and strengths, while the **RxNorm API** links all identified drugs to their **RxCUI** for accurate interaction checking.
